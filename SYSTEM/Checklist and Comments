Checklist and Comments

EXISTING UI DESIGN
LOGIN/LOGOUT			-	Looks okay. Thought the popup of "Logging out..." can be replaced by an inquiry as
							"Are you sure to logout?" or "Confirm Logout" instead.
=====ADMIN mode?=====
HOME DASHBOARD			- 	"Home" ; To work on ; Changed image to decent resolution.
INVENTORY				- 	"Master Files -> Products" ; Will add some features such as Print and sorting etc.
	Edit Products 		-	Remove editing quantity, wait, is this connected to the inventory report somehow?
							Needs changing the method of resupplying.
REQUEST					- 	"Master Files -> Admin -> Request" ; IDEK what that is and its purpose. Seems vague.
SUPPLIERS				- 	"Master Files -> Admin -> Supplier" ; Is this for auditing purposes? 
							Do we need to add a supplier list before ordering? (To defer?)
ORDER REPORTS			-	"Reports -> Order Report" ; Is this the checkout from the S&M department? 
							Or is this the report AFTER processing said order. Needs order status column.
INVENTORY REPORTS 		-	"Reports -> Inventory Report" ; Is this connected with the entries from 
							"ORDER REPORTS"?

TODO:
PENDING ORDERS			-	Need to check how S&M handles checkout. 
RESTOCKING?				-	Need to rework restocking instead of editing product quantity.
DATABASE				-	Need to assess notes from Simone and Mavbbvbvbvbin.
PRODUCT DELIVERY		-	Together with PENDING ORDERS. Need to assess checkout and post details for A&F.
HR ATTENDANCE			-	Attendance form from HR team.
ADDITIONALS				-	Included on the note received from Njay as per Sir Yno's request.
